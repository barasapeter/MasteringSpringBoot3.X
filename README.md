# Other Integrations
## Learning suplimentary tools that work alongside
*RabbitMQ* is an open-source message broker that enables applications to communicate asynchronously, acting as a central hub for message queuing and routing

*Apache Kafka*  is an open-source distributed streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines, streaming applications, and data integration at scale. It acts as a publish-subscribe messaging system that stores streams of records in a fault-tolerant and durable way, allowing producers to write data to topics and consumers to read from them. Key use cases include real-time analytics, log aggregation, and event-driven architectures. 

* Don't forget testing. Start practicing working with testing tools.

*Docker* Docker is like a special bus for our apps.
It makes sure they run smoothly, no matter where they go.

*Kubernetes* Think of it as the big boss of buses. It organizes all our app
containers and makes sure they’re all working together properly.
