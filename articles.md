# What are the principles behind microservices?
The six main principles behind microservices are autonomy, loose coupling, reuse, fault tolerance,
composability, and discoverability. Let me explain a bit more about each one:

*Autonomy* means that each microservice is independent and in control of its own runtime and database. This makes it faster and
more reliable since it’s not dependent on other services. As long as it stays stateless, it can also scale up easily.

*Loose coupling* means the services don’t rely too much on each other. By using standardized APIs, one service can change
without affecting the others. This allows for more flexibility and evolution over time. It also makes development and fixes faster.

*Reuse* is still important but at a more specific domain level within the business. Teams can decide how to adapt services for new
uses case by case. This guided reuse approach is better than a rigid predetermined model.

*Fault tolerance* means each service can keep working even if another fails. Things like circuit breakers stop individual failures
from spreading. This keeps the whole system reliable.

*Composability* means services can deliver value in different combinations. Multiple services working together become the new
way of building applications.

*Discoverability* means each service clearly communicates what business problem it solves and how other teams can use its
technical interface. This makes it easy for developers to understand the microservices’ functionality and how to consume the
events it publishes.

In summary, these six principles of autonomy, loose coupling, reuse, fault tolerance, composability,
and discoverability form the foundation of microservices architecture.
